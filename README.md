# This is my first README file

In current repo I'm going to learn how to create the perfect code and amaizing git commits

## Python example
'''python
    for line in lines:
        print(line[0])
'''

### My TODO list

- [x] Write README.md
- [ ] Subscribe to devman at [https://devman.org](https://devman.org)
